# DAN
This is a working prototype of a personalized customer service chat bot created at first bank innovative hackathon 2018.

DAN can answer FAQ's and also perform simple tasks like creating bank accounts, making bank transfers, checking how eligible a customer is for a loan, telling you how far you are from the nearest first bank(This is only limited to lagos state) etc.

DAN can tell you how far you are from the nearest first bank, tell you exactly where it is and show you a google maps directing you to the place, it also tells you how long it would take to get there if you drive and how long it would take if you walk!.

Try asking it questions like, "i want to create a bank account", "i want to make a transfer", How far am i from the nearest first bank" etc

DAN can be accessed live via the link  https://firstbank-customer-assistant.herokuapp.com/

Fell free to give Dan a try!

DISCLAIMER: DAN isn't a fully working bot, DAN is just a working prototype built in less than two days at the first bank innovative hackathon
